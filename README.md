## Project Overview
Manta Polls is a simple decentralized polling application built on the Manta Network. This project was developed as part of the EthSEA Coinfest 2024 Hackathon, focusing on the SocialFi track.

### Developer's Note
As a solo participant with basic coding skills, I embarked on this hackathon as a personal challenge to push my boundaries and learn new technologies. This project represents a significant learning journey, where I went from struggling with front-end basics to successfully deploying a functional decentralized application.

## Problem Statement
In the realm of SocialFi, there's a need for transparent, decentralized voting mechanisms that can be easily integrated into various platforms. Manta Polls aims to provide a simple, yet effective solution for creating and participating in polls using blockchain technology.

## Solution
Manta Polls leverages the Manta Network to offer a decentralized polling system. Users can create polls, vote on existing polls, and view results in real-time. The use of blockchain ensures transparency and immutability of the voting process.

## Key Features
- Create polls with multiple options
- Vote on existing polls
- Real-time result visualization
- Decentralized architecture ensuring vote integrity

## Technology Stack
- Smart Contracts: Solidity
- Frontend: Next.js, React
- UI Components: ShadCN
- Blockchain Interaction: ethers.js
- Network: Manta Pacific Sepolia Testnet

## Contract Address
The smart contract for Manta Polls is deployed at:
[0x3da8ea380Fc9bEe79E8016b7Ade75B94795eE595](https://pacific-explorer.sepolia-testnet.manta.network/address/0x3da8ea380Fc9bEe79E8016b7Ade75B94795eE595)

## How Manta Network's Technology is Utilized
Manta Polls is deployed on the Manta Pacific Sepolia Testnet, leveraging Manta Network's EVM-compatible layer for fast and cost-effective transactions. The project demonstrates the potential for building user-friendly SocialFi applications on Manta Network.

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure your Manta Pacific Sepolia network in MetaMask
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
6. Connect your wallet and start interacting with the polls!

## Challenges and Learning
The development of Manta Polls came with its fair share of challenges:
- Learning front-end development from scratch
- Understanding and implementing blockchain interactions
- Debugging and troubleshooting in a new development environment

These challenges led to significant learning outcomes, including familiarity with React and Next.js, understanding of smart contract interactions, and experience with decentralized application architecture.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement user profiles and reputation systems
- Add more complex polling options (e.g., ranked choice voting)
- Integrate with other SocialFi platforms for wider reach
- Figure out how to reduce gas fees for contract interactions.

## Conclusion
Manta Polls, while simple in its current form, serves as a proof of concept for decentralized voting systems on the Manta Network. It demonstrates the potential for building user-friendly SocialFi applications and provides a foundation for more complex systems in the future.
